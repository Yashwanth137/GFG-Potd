Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Each array element represents the maximum length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element. This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y ≤ x.
Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
<br>
Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.

#### Examples : 
```
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 
Explanation:First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3.
From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will
jump to the last. 
```
```
Input: arr = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7}
Output: 2 
Explanation: First we jump from the 1st to 2nd element and then jump to the last element.
```
```
Input: arr = {0, 10, 20}
Output: -1
Explanation: We cannot go anywhere from the 1st element.
```
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
```
