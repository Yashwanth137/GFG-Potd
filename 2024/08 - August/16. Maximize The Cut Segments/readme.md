Given an integer n denoting the Length of a line segment. You need to cut the line segment in such a way that the cut length of a line segment each time is either x , y or z. Here x, y, and z are integers.
After performing all the cut operations, your total number of cut segments must be maximum. Return the maximum number of cut segments possible.
<br>
Note: if no segment can be cut then return 0.
