Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.
<br>
A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.

#### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
#### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree)

#### Constraints:
#### 2 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
#### 1 ≤ node value ≤ 10^5
