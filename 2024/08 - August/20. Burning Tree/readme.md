Given a binary tree and a node data called target. Find the minimum time required to burn the complete binary tree if the target is set on fire. It is known that in 1 second all nodes connected to a given node get burned. That is its left child, right child, and parent.

Note: The tree contains unique values.

#### Expected Time Complexity: O(number of nodes)
#### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of tree)


#### Constraints:
#### 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5

#### 1 ≤ values of nodes ≤ 10^5
