Find the largest pair sum in an array of distinct integers.

#### Examples :
```
Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 10, 6, 40]
Output: 74
Explanation: The sum of 34 and 40 is the largest, i.e, 34 + 40 = 74.
```
```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: 50
Explanation: 20 + 30 = 50.
```
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
```
