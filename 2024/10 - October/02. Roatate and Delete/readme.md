Given an array arr integers. Assume sz to be the initial size of the array. Do the following operations exactly sz/2 times. In every kth (1<= k <= sz/2) operation:

  - Right-rotate the array clockwise by 1.
  - Delete the (n– k + 1)th element from begin.

Now, Return the first element of the array. <br>
Note: Here n keeps on decreasing with every operation.

#### Examples:
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: Rotate the array clockwise i.e. after rotation the array arr = [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and delete
the last element that is 5 that will be arr = [6, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Again rotate the array for the second time
and deletes the second last element that is 2 that will be A = [4, 6, 1, 3], doing similar operation when
we perform 4th operation, 4th last element does not exist. Then we deletes 1st element ie 1 that will be
arr = [3, 6]. So, continuing this procedure the last element in arr is 2. So, the output will be 3.
```
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: Rotate the vector clockwise i.e. after rotation the vector arr = [4, 1, 2, 3] and delete
the last element that is 3 that will be arr = [4, 1, 2]. After doing all the operations, the output will be 2.
```
```
Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
```
