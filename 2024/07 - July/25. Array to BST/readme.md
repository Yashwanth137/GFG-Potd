Given a sorted array. Convert it into a Height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). Return the root of the BST.
  
Height-balanced BST means a binary tree in which the depth of the left and right subtree of every node never differ by more than 1.
  
Note: The driver code will check the BST, if it is a Height-balanced BST, the output will be true otherwise the output will be false.
