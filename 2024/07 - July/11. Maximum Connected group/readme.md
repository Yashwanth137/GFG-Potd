You are given a square binary grid. A grid is considered binary if every value in the grid is either 1 or 0. You can change at most one cell in the grid from 0 to 1. You need to find the largest group of connected  1's. Two cells are said to be connected if both are adjacent to each other and both have the same value.

#### Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
#### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n^2)

#### Constraints:
#### 1 <= size of the grid<= 500
#### 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1
