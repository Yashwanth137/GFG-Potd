# Duplicate Subtrees
#### Difficulty: Medium, Accuracy: 23.98%, Submissions: 51K+, Points: 4
Given a binary tree, your task is to find all duplicate subtrees from the given binary tree.

#### Duplicate Subtree : Two trees are duplicates if they have the same structure with the same node values.

Note:  Return the root of each tree in the form of a list array & the driver code will print the tree in pre-order tree traversal in lexicographically increasing order.
