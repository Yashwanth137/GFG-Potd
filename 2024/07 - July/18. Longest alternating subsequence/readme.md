You are given an array arr. Your task is to find the longest length of a good sequence. A good sequence {x1, x2, .. xn} is an alternating sequence if its elements satisfy one of the following relations :
<br>
1.  x1 < x2 > x3 < x4 > x5. . . . . and so on  
2.  x1 >x2 < x3 > x4 < x5. . . . . and so on
