Given a square matrix mat[][] of size n x n. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. 

#### Examples:
```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3],
                  [4, 5, 6]
                  [7, 8, 9]]
Output: Rotated Matrix:
[3, 6, 9]
[2, 5, 8]
[1, 4, 7]
```
```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2],
                  [3, 4]]
Output: Rotated Matrix:
[2, 4]
[1, 3]
```
```
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^2
0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^3
```
