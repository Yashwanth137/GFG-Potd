Implement the function power(b, e), which calculates b raised to the power of e (i.e. be).

#### Examples:
```
Input: b = 3.00000, e = 5
Output: 243.00000
```
```
Input: b = 0.55000, e = 3
Output: 0.16638
```
```
Input: b = -0.67000, e = -7
Output: -16.49971
```
```
Constraints:

    -100.0 < b < 100.0
    -109 <= e <= 109
    Either b is not zero or e > 0.
    -104 <= be <= 104

```
