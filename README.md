# POTD Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the "Problem of the Day" (POTD) challenges from Geeks for Geeks, implemented in C++.

## Overview

Every day, Geeks for Geeks provides a challenging programming problem as part of their POTD series. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these problems, written in C++.

## Folder Structure

- **`/Solutions/`**: Contains subdirectories named after each day's POTD.
  - Each day's directory contains:
    - `solution.cpp`: C++ code implementing the solution.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashwanth137/potd-solutions.git
